**Students Performance in Exams**

**Description**
This data set consists of the marks secured by the students in various subjects.

From this dataset, we are trying to understand which factors may affect the student's performance. In order to discover correlations between factors, we will classify the scores into several unique groups.

Let's pay attention that dataset consists of five independent variables which are:

gender: sex of students (male, female)
race/ethnicity: race of students (A-E groups)
parental level of education: parents' final education
lunch: having lunch before test (standard, free/reduced)
test preparation course: having completed the preparation course before the test (none,completed)
